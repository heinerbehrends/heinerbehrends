# Hello, I'm Heiner ðŸ‘‹

I'm a designer and self taught developer. With my background as a stage designer it comes naturally to me to care about user experience. That's why I specialize in front-end development using the react ecosystem and the PWA frameworks Gatsby and Nextjs.

ðŸ’» I'm currently working as my own boss at [flyfi web development](https://www.flyfi.nl)
âš¡ flyfi specializes in building highly performant progressive web apps
ðŸ§© I'm currently upping my skills on: 
  - TypeScript
  - Cypress integration and end-to-end testing
  - serverless backend and database services
  - writing beautiful code
  - designing beautiful websites

## My personal projects
On my journey to become a developer I learned a lot by building personal projects, that challenged different kinds of skills and helped me to learn different technologies like react, css-in-js, testing, redux, gatsby and nextjs, immutable data structures and serverless functions.

### ðŸ¦  Simulating Virus Dynamics
An implementation of the problem set 12 of the MIT course 6.00 Introduction to computer science and programming
It is build using typescript and relies on functional programming priciples like closures for information hiding, pure functions and immutable data structures. This approach leads to a more maintable code base and less mental overload, compared to an object oriented approach that uses shared mutable state. Uses the ramda library for its map and mapAccum functions, recharts for data visualisation, react-query to manage server state and the nextjs framework.
Check out the interactive simulation on Vercel: https://virus-simulation-next.vercel.app/
### ðŸ”  Pizzazz - An online multiplayer micro-scrabble game
Pizzazz consists of a react frontend that uses Redux and Redux-Saga for async state management and a nodejs backend. Web sockets are used to for fast bi-directional communication between the server and the client. Pizzazz is build using create-react-app and hosted on heroku, so it takes a long time to load. Check it out at https://pizzazz-micro-scrabble.herokuapp.com/.
### ðŸ§  Giphy concentration
Giphy concentration is an online version of the children's game concentration, also known as Memory in Europe. It uses a search box and the Giphy API to fetch animated gifs. Check it out on Netlify: https://pedantic-lumiere-aac884.netlify.app/
### ðŸŒ± Game of Life React
An implementation of Conwell's Game of Life for the react library. It features the possibility to seed many different patterns like methusalems, oscillators and space ships, controls for the speed and a start/stop button. Check it out on Netlify: https://focused-edison-3a5dcc.netlify.app/
Game of Life is build using the [immer library](immerjs.github.io/) for immutable data structures. The size of the game automatically adapts to the size of the screen.
