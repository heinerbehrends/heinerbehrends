# Heiner S. Behrends

I'm a web developer and designer with a background in stage design. It comes naturally to me to care about user experience and so I specialize in front-end development. My main expertise is with building web apps with React and ecosystem that surrounds it.

💻 After a great start at [Embrace - the Human Cloud](https://www.embracecloud.nl/) ☁️ I'm currently working at [Mediahuis Nederland](https://https://www.mediahuis.nl/) 📰 as a front-end developer, building the app and the new website with React and TypeScript. Before I worked as my own boss at [flyfi web development](https://www.flyfi.nl). flyfi specialized in building performant progressive web apps ⚡.

## My personal projects
On my journey to become a developer I learned a lot by building personal projects, that challenged different kinds of skills and helped me to learn different technologies like react, css-in-js, testing, redux, gatsby and nextjs, immutable data structures and serverless functions. Here are some of the more recent examples.

### 🎵 React-Audio-Player - A headless audio player library
React-Audio-Player is an open source NPM package. I developed the library to fulfill a personal need: a robust and easy-to-use audio player for React applications that solves all the problems of working with the HTML audio element and at the same time offers great flexiblity when it comes to styling and composing user interfaces. https://github.com/heinerbehrends/react-audio-player

### 🔠 Pizzazz - An online multiplayer micro-scrabble game
Pizzazz is to scrabble what a blog post is to a tweet. Pizzazz consists of a react frontend that uses Redux and Redux-Saga for async state management and a nodejs backend. Web sockets are used for fast bi-directional communication between the server and the client. I [rewrote the application](https://github.com/heinerbehrends/pizzazz) with TypeScript, XState an Partykit. 
### 🦠 Simulating Virus Dynamics
An implementation of the [problem set 12 of the MIT course 6.00 Introduction to computer science and programming](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-fall-2008/assignments/pset12.pdf) using the Nextjs framework to combine nodejs server code and react client code.
It is build using typescript and relies on functional programming priciples like closures for information hiding, pure functions and immutable data structures. This approach leads to a more maintable code base and less mental overload, compared to an object oriented approach that uses shared mutable state. Uses the ramda library for its map and mapAccum functions, recharts for data visualisation, react-query to manage server state and the nextjs framework.
Check out the interactive simulation on Vercel: https://virus-simulation-next.vercel.app/
### 🎸 We're The Buzz - website
Design and implementation of a website for my New Wave band The Buzz. Featuring a videowall that adapts its height to the screen size, a custom hook parallax effect using requestAnimationFrame and a special audio player. Uses a Hasura database and Netlify functions to save the heart count of each song. Build with Gatsby and TypeScript. Check it out on Netlify: https://werethebuzz.netlify.app/
### 🧠 Giphy concentration/memory
Giphy concentration is an online version of the children's game concentration, known as Memory in Europe. It uses a search box and the Giphy API to fetch animated gifs. Build with TypeScript and Remix it uses serverless functions and environment variables to hide the Giphy API Key. Check it out on Vercel: https://remix-vercel-test-b84xhuwpu-heinerbehrends.vercel.app/
### 🌱 Game of Life React
An implementation of Conwell's Game of Life for the react library. It features the possibility to seed many different patterns like methusalems, oscillators and space ships, controls for the speed and a start/stop button. Check it out on Netlify: https://game-of-life-immer.netlify.app/
Game of Life is build using Redux for state management and the [immer library](immerjs.github.io/) for immutable data structures. The size of the game automatically adapts to the size of the screen.
